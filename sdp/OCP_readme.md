## The "Specification Pattern". 
### This pattern allows you to build a clear specification of business rules, where objects can be checked against these specifications. It's particularly useful in scenarios where you need to filter out objects based on some criteria, and these criteria might be combined or changed at runtime.

In your example, you have an `Specification` interface that declares a method `isSatisfied(product *Product) bool`. This method is intended to return `true` if the `product` satisfies the specification, and `false` otherwise.

For concrete specifications, I've implemented:

- `ColorSpecification`: checks if a product's color matches a specified color.
- `SizeSpecification`: checks if a product's size matches a specified size.
- `ColorSizeSpecification`: checks if a product's color and size match specified color and size, respectively.

These specifications are straightforward because they directly compare properties of the `Product` with the criteria defined within the specification itself (e.g., `c.color == product.color` for `ColorSpecification`).

The `AndSpecification` is a composite specification. Instead of checking a single criterion, it combines two specifications (`first` and `second`) and checks if a `Product` satisfies both. The magic of the composite specification is in its flexibility and in how it adheres to the Composite Design Pattern, allowing you to nest multiple specifications together in a tree structure if needed.

When you call `isSatisfied(product *Product)` on an `AndSpecification` instance, the method executes the `isSatisfied` method of both the `first` and `second` specifications it holds. It then returns `true` only if both specifications are satisfied (`true`), meaning both `first.isSatisfied(product)` and `second.isSatisfied(product)` must return `true`. If either returns `false`, the `AndSpecification`'s `isSatisfied` method will also return `false`.

This works seamlessly because each specification, including those nested within an `AndSpecification`, adheres to the `Specification` interface. This design allows any object that implements the `Specification` interface to be used interchangeably, enabling the composition of complex specifications from simpler ones without the need to explicitly define how each specification checks the product. The implementation of `isSatisfied` within each concrete specification handles the specific logic for checking the product against its criteria.

In summary, the `AndSpecification` works by relying on the polymorphic behavior of the `Specification` interface. Each concrete specification provides its own implementation of `isSatisfied`, which `AndSpecification` invokes on its nested specifications to determine if a product satisfies the composite criteria.
